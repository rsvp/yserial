                    <p>This entry is the second in my series describing various Mercurial workflows.
The <a href="http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/02/mercurial-workflows-branch-as-needed/">first</a> describes the simplest one: branching only&nbsp;when&nbsp;necessary.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re working on a larger project you might want something with a bit more
structure. This post is about the &#8220;stable and&nbsp;default&#8221;&nbsp;workflow.</p>
<div class="toc">
</div>
<h2 id="stable-and-default-in-a-nutshell"><span class="dquo"><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span></span>Stable and Default&#8221; in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Nutshell</h2>
<p>The general idea of this workflow is that you keep two branches: <code>default</code> and
<code>stable</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>default</code></strong> is the branch where new features and functionality&nbsp;are&nbsp;added.</li>
<li><strong><code>stable</code></strong> is where bug fixes are added, as well as documentation improvements
  that don&#8217;t pertain to&nbsp;new&nbsp;features.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each time you make a bug fix in <code>stable</code> you merge it into <code>default</code>, so
<code>default</code> is always a superset of <code>stable</code>.</p>
<p>Periodically (whenever you&#8217;re ready for a &#8220;major release&#8221;) you&#8217;ll merge
<code>default</code> into <code>stable</code> so new features can be included&nbsp;in&nbsp;releases.</p>
<p><i><a href="http://hg-scm.org/">Mercurial</a> itself <a href="http://selenic.com/repo/hg/branches/">uses</a> this workflow for development, so it
can scale well to projects of moderate to&nbsp;large&nbsp;size.</i></p>
<h2 id="branch-setup">Branch&nbsp;Setup</h2>
<p>To get started using this workflow you&#8217;ll need to create a <code>stable</code> named&nbsp;branch:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="go">hg branch stable</span>
<span class="go">hg commit -m &quot;Create the stable branch.&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Once you do this users of your project can clone the <code>stable</code> branch and be
confident that they&#8217;re getting a relatively stable version of your code.  To
clone a branch like this they would do&nbsp;something&nbsp;like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="go">hg clone http://bitbucket.org/you/yourproject#stable</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This will clone your project&#8217;s repository and include only changesets on the
<code>stable</code> branch (and any of&nbsp;their&nbsp;ancestors).</p>
<h2 id="making-changes">Making&nbsp;Changes</h2>
<p>The goal of this workflow is to do all non-bugfix development on the <code>default</code>
branch.  Pure bug fixes should go on the <code>stable</code> branch so <code>stable</code> stays as,
well, &#8220;stable&#8221;&nbsp;as&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>Users that want to live on the bleeding edge of development can use the
<code>default</code> branch of your project.  Hopefully your project has some users that
are willing to work with <code>default</code> and inform you of bugs found with the new
functionality you add&nbsp;to&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Whenever you make a change to <code>stable</code> you&#8217;ll want to merge it into <code>default</code>
so that <code>default</code> always remains a superset of <code>stable</code>. This makes <code>default</code>
as stable as it can possibly be.  It also makes it easier to merge <code>default</code>
back into stable whenever you&#8217;re ready for a&nbsp;major&nbsp;release.</p>
<h2 id="releasing-major-versions">Releasing&nbsp;Major&nbsp;Versions</h2>
<p>There will come a time when you&#8217;re ready to release non-bugfix improvements to
your project to the general public. Non-bugfix improvements are made in the
<code>default</code> branch, so when you&#8217;re ready to do this you&#8217;ll merge <code>default</code> into
<code>stable</code>.</p>
<p>Because your project has more <code>stable</code> users than bleeding-edge users, you&#8217;ll
probably get more bug reports than usual after you release a major version.
This is to be expected and you should be ready&nbsp;for&nbsp;it.</p>
<h2 id="tagging-releases">Tagging&nbsp;Releases</h2>
<p>Any decent project should tag releases.  This lets users easily use a version
of your project that they&nbsp;know&nbsp;works.</p>
<p>Wondering how to decide when to tag releases, and what to use for the tags?
The <a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> specification is a great guide that makes it
easy for your users to know (in a broad sense) what each&nbsp;release&nbsp;changes.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, tags in a semantically versioned project work&nbsp;like&nbsp;this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tags are of the form&nbsp;&#8220;v[<span class="caps"><span class="caps">MAJOR</span></span>].[<span class="caps"><span class="caps">MINOR</span></span>].[<span class="caps"><span class="caps">BUGFIX</span></span>]&#8221;</li>
<li>Tags with a major version of &#8220;0&#8221; make no guarantees about anything. They are
  used for alpha/beta versions of&nbsp;the&nbsp;project.</li>
<li>An increase in the bugfix version of a project means &#8220;bugs&nbsp;were&nbsp;fixed.&#8221;</li>
<li>An increase in the minor version of a project means &#8220;functionality has been
  added without breaking&nbsp;backwards&nbsp;compatibility.&#8221;</li>
<li>An increase in the major version of a project means &#8220;backwards compatibility
  has&nbsp;been&nbsp;broken.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately this workflow makes it a bit more complicated to add semantic
versioning tags to your project. The rules for semantic tagging would work&nbsp;like&nbsp;this:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you fix a bug on the <code>stable</code> branch, increment the bugfix version on
  <code>stable</code> and merge <code>stable</code> into <code>default</code>.</li>
<li>When you add new functionality and are ready to release it to the public,
  merge <code>default</code> into stable and increment the minor version of <code>stable</code>.</li>
<li>When you&#8217;re ready for a backwards-incompatible release, merge <code>default</code> into
  stable and increment the major version of <code>stable</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with this is that <code>default</code> never has any version tags. However,
this probably isn&#8217;t a big deal because users of <code>default</code> are those that want
to live on the bleeding edge of your project and aren&#8217;t as concerned&nbsp;with&nbsp;stability.</p>
<h2 id="why-default-and-stable-instead-of-default-and-dev">Why "Default and
Stable" Instead of "Default&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dev"?</h2>
<p>In the workflow I&#8217;ve described there are two branches: <code>default</code> and <code>stable</code>.
You might be wondering why <code>default</code> is used for new development and the
&#8220;stable&#8221; branch is relegated to a&nbsp;named&nbsp;branch.</p>
<p>The reason is that <code>default</code> will typically have many, many more changesets
added to it than <code>stable</code>, and so making the &#8220;development&#8221; branch the default
makes it easier on&nbsp;the&nbsp;developers.</p>
<p>There is absolutely <em>nothing</em> wrong with making <code>default</code> the &#8220;stable&#8221; branch
and creating a <code>dev</code> branch for &#8220;unstable&#8221; changes. If your project rarely adds
new functionality but is more concerned with fixing bugs this version of the
workflow will obviously be better&nbsp;for&nbsp;you. 
This alternative also has the feature of giving users that <i>naively</i> clone
your project (without a branch specified) the stable version.  Since many users
don&#8217;t bother to read instructions even when you provide them, there is a strong
argument for using it even when your project is <em>not</em> overly concerned with&nbsp;bug&nbsp;fixes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s up to you to decide which version you want&nbsp;to&nbsp;use.</p>
<h2 id="we-choose-default-and-stable">[ We choose "Default
and Stable" -- let naive users have the bleeding edge ;-]</h2>
